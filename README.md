These are my Klipper config files that I use for my TwoTree Sapphire Plus. 
These are for a BigTreeTech Manta M8P v1.1 in CAN mode.
Make sure you change your PINS to match your board.
There are 2 TMC driver config files. TMC5160 and TMC2209. TMC2209 has never been tested. 
If you are using any TMC SPI drivers use the TMC5160 just change the driver name and sense_resistor.
If you use TMC2208 drivers you will have to make your own DRIVER.CFG file to match your pins.
