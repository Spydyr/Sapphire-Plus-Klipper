[z_tilt]
z_positions: 10,186
             280,186
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
points: 10,186
        280,186
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
speed: 600
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 20
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: 0.01
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.

[gcode_macro G34]
gcode: z_tilt_adjust
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute in place of "my_cmd". See
#   docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#variable_<name>: 
#   One may specify any number of options with a "variable_" prefix.
#   The given variable name will be assigned the given value (parsed
#   as a Python literal) and will be available during macro expansion.
#   For example, a config with "variable_fan_speed = 75" might have
#   gcode commands containing "M106 S{ fan_speed * 255 }". Variables
#   can be changed at run-time using the SET_GCODE_VARIABLE command
#   (see docs/Command_Templates.md for details). Variable names may
#   not use upper case characters.
#rename_existing:
#   This option will cause the macro to override an existing G-Code
#   command and provide the previous definition of the command via the
#   name provided here. This can be used to override builtin G-Code
#   commands. Care should be taken when overriding commands as it can
#   cause complex and unexpected results. The default is to not
#   override an existing G-Code command.
#description: G-Code macro
#   This will add a short description used at the HELP command or while
#   using the auto completion feature. Default "G-Code macro"
